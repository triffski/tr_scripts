## Scripts & Batch Files

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|google_saved_places_exporter.py|Convert stuff you've saved in your Google Maps account for use anywhere that can import GeoJSON, KML or CSV data (OsmAnd, Organic Maps etc). "Saved" list CSVs become one GeoJSON/KML/CSV per list, with coordinates. <br/><br/> Stage 2 will also process a 'Saved Places.json' containing *all* of your saved locations, exclude any found in the .csv files, then use the Maps API to reverse geocode the remainder to the nearest found location (within 25m).|

# Google Saved Places Exporter
  
The full pipeline needs two inputs from **Google Takeout** (takeout.google.com), coming from two *different* Takeout products, plus a Google API key, saved to `google_api_ket.txt`. Whack this into a single line text file, in the same folder as the script.<br/>

Run: `python3 google_saved_places_pipeline.py {data location} {output folder}`</br>Example: `python3 google_saved_places_pipeline.py . ./output_places`

### Getting your data from Google

#### Stage 1 (Required) - Per-list CSVs
1. Go to Takeout, **Deselect all**, then select only **"Saved"**.
2. Export, download the zip, and unzip.
3. Inside the `Takeout/Saved/` folder you'll find **one CSV per list** (`Beer Gardens.csv`,
   `Wanna Go.csv`, etc.) — these are the pipeline's main input.<br/>

⚠️ Select **"Saved"**, NOT "Maps (your places)" — the latter gives a single merged
JSON with no per-list split, which Stage 1 can't use.

#### Stage 2 (Optional) - Saved Places.json
Google won't export your **Starred** list directly (it's private/non-shareable), so Stage 2 reconstructs it from the merged export by elimination.
1. In Takeout, **Deselect all**, then select **"Maps (your places)"**.
2. Export, download, unzip.
3. Inside `Maps (your places)/` is **`Saved Places.json`** — drop it in the input folder, alongside the CSVs. If `Saved Places.json` isn't present, Stage 2 is skipped.
  
| Input | If present | If missing |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Per-list `*.csv` | Stage 1 geocodes each list → `.geojson/.kml/.gpx` | Stage 1 produces nothing (silent — check your input folder) |
| `Saved Places.json` (space or underscore) | Stage 2 reconstructs the Starred/visited list | Stage 2 skipped cleanly |
| `.cache/` | Lookups reused — run is near-free | Full API calls (writes cache for next time) |

#### Notes

- **Cache** absence never breaks a run, it just means that run pays full API price (generally free), then caches the results for next time.
- **Stage dependency:** Stage 2 excludes places already matched in Stage 1's CSV output. If the merged file is present but the CSVs are **not**, Stage 2 has nothing to exclude against and will reverse-geocode the *entire* merged file as if all of it were Starred (no confirmed matches). Normal use (both present) avoids this.
- **Known limitation:** unhinted global lists are geocoded by name, so ambiguous names (e.g. "San José") can resolve to a bar in Dublin. Add a region to `LIST_HINTS`, or spot-fix outliers after import, then re-run over the cached data.
